        Hey everyone. My name is Kermit Bonner I'm a fourth generation Kermit.
        Every one I know calls me Chris or Kerm tho. I am an aspiring developer.
        I have a 2 year old daughter named Charlie. She is the main reason I am
        pursuing a career in web development. I have a background in customer
        facing and sales. I bring a technical background to a professional
        salesman. I can interact with any customer, speak with large groups and
        able to interact well with a development team. I have a major passion
        for anything competitive. I think that's what made me such a good
        salesman. I love just about all professional sports especially football
        and baseball. I'm a avid fantasy football nut. I stay up to date with as
        many video games as possible.
